                "question": "Is SetWise fast to use during a workout?",

                "question": "Can it handle my training style (strength, bodybuilding, powerbuilding)?",

SetWise uses LLM-powered parsing to recognize exercises, sets, reps, and common set types - then converts it into a clean, structured workout you can log instantly. It's designed to handle different writing styles and messy formatting."

            {
                "question": "Will this feel too advanced or complicated?",
                "answer": "No. SetWise adapts to your style - keep it simple with weight/reps only, or toggle Advanced Tracking when you want details like RPE / RIR, tempo, ROM, and intensifiers."

                "question": "Can I see progress per exercise (not just overall)?",
