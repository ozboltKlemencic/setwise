                "question": "Can it handle my training style (strength, bodybuilding, powerbuilding)?",
                "answer": "Yes. It supports straight sets, supersets, and advanced set types (e.g., drop sets, rest-pause, myo-reps), so it fits most programs."

                "answer": "Paste any workout as plain text (from Notes, WhatsApp, Excel, or copied text). SetWise uses LLM-powered parsing to recognize exercises, sets, reps, and common set types - then converts it into a clean, structured workout you can log instantly. It's designed to handle different writing styles and messy formatting."

                "question": "Will this feel too advanced or complicated?",

                "question": "Can I see progress per exercise (not just overall)?",
